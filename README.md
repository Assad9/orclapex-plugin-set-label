Oracle Application Express Plug-in: Set Label

Oracle Application Express comes with a Dynamic Action called "Set Value".
This Dynamic Action will set the value of an item. In analogy to the Dynamic Action: Set Value, Set Label will set the label of an item. Just like Set Value it will be possible to define multiple items in the Effected Elements, so labels of the different items are set at once.
